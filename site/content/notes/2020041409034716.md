A prototypical read workflow with ThoughtTank can look like this:

- Create literature notes or mark important passages while reading a text (This is typically done outside of ThoughtTank. ThoughtTank uses the concept of the inbox to support those collecting the literature notes).
- Transfer the most important ideas from the literature notes to the permanent notes in the inbox
- Assign to a topic
- Define keywords
-Link the permanent note (possibly the keywords already lead to related notes - implicit links, which can now be linked explicitly).
- Do not forget the other direction: Which notes should link the new note?
- Set tags

**Checklist**

- Ensure that the note is accessible in a few steps from an entry point.
