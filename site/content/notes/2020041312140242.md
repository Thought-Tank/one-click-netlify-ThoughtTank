title: Usefulness of notes without (implicit) context
topics: Thought Tank
summary: A note is difficult to reuse if it needs its implied context to be
  understood. An implicit context is created by assigning categories, tags or
  keywords and can change after the note has been created. If the meaning of a
  note depends on its current implicit context, the author cannot use the note
  alone, but would also have to record the current context.

Enter a note in such a way that it is understandable in itself and that the information it contains depends at most on the explicit links.
